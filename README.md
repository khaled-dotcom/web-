# Envelope Animation with Music 🎵

This project is an interactive envelope animation built with jQuery. When the envelope is clicked or the open button is pressed, it opens and plays a song. The reset button closes the envelope and stops the music.

## 🚀 Features
- Click the envelope or the open button to open it.
- A song plays when the envelope opens.
- Press the reset button to close the envelope and stop the music.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery (JavaScript)

## 🎵 How It Works
- The `open()` function adds the `.open` class to animate the envelope and plays the song.
- The `close()` function adds the `.close` class to reset the animation and stop the music.
- The `Audio` object is used to handle the sound playback.
